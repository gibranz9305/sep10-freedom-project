# Entry 2
## Context
Regarding technology used in *cooking*, I have found many different things. Besides basic things like cooking apps, I have found _"smart"_ appliances that use Wi-Fi, and precision cooking tools like air fryers that uses percise temepratures to cook food. Some cooking apps I have discovered are [paprika](paprikaapp.com), which is an app that allows people to organize their own recipes, clip recipies from browsers like google, and create grocery lists as well as meal plans. An example of a "smart" cooking appliance is the *Instant Pot* from [this](https://instantpot.com/collections/wifi/products/instant-pot-pro-max-6qt-multi-cooker) website, which has built in Wi-Fi and has over 2000 recipies available. It has over 10 cooking functions, has voice control with Alexa, and had a quiet cooking time. This instant pot is a great example of how technology can be used to make cooking hassle-free and more efficent. 
## Sources
For my sources, I used google searches like "technology used in cooking" to find what common and uncommon technological advances are used in cooking to imporve efficency. I also viewed the top websities, like instantpot which told me what exactly these appliances have.
## EDP
Currently at my project, I believe I am at step 3 of the *EDP* (_Engineering Design Process_) as I have still not planned the most *promising* solution, which is step 4. I am still brainstorming and planning how I will organize and execute my creative project, through my notes and blogs like this one. I belive I will be at step 4 when I can finish my planning and know what my final information will be that I can apply towards my project.
## Skills
Some skills I have been developing in are Communication and Problem Composition. The reason for picking these skills was because I communicated with my classmates to give me ideas on how to succesfully complete this Blog. When I first got this assignment, I split the work based on the rubric and tackled each thing one by one, breaking it down and making it easier for my to complete each section. With the communication of my classmates and I, and breaking down the Blog into many different parts, it became easier for me and made it possible to complete it.
