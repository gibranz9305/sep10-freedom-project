## My Freedom Project Topic
For my **Software Engineering Project** creative topic the topic I chose was cooking. The reason I chose the topic of cooking is because I notice how the world of tehcnology and coding has slowly made its way into something which doesnt really seem like it has any correlation to it. I wanted to describe and demonstrate how technology is making its way into things that it might not seem "appropriate" for, like cooking. My other two options were construction and graphic design, as I like these topics in general and wanted to demonstrate how technology impacts them.

### Sources
For my sources, I am using **[links like these](https://kosciuskoconnect.com/blog/how-technology-is-changing-the-way-we-cook/)** which show me how exaclty tehcnology and coding is being brought to cooking to help with efficency and overall imporving interactions for people in daily life. In links [like these](https://ajeanneinthekitchen.com/2024/03/06/cooking-with-technology/), they talk about the benefits that technology brings and how exaclty technology benefits and is making the topic of cooking turn out for the better. For my backup ideas, like **construction** I was going to use a link like [this](https://www.rhumbix.com/blog/how-technology-in-construction-is-revolutionizing-the-industry) to demonstrate how technology is helping worksites by making them safer and using 3D printing to increase efficency.
