## My Freedom Project Topic
For my **Software Engineering Project** creative topic the topic I chose was cooking. The reason I chose the topic of cooking is because I notice how the world of tehcnology and coding has slowly made its way into something which doesnt really seem like it has any correlation to it. I wanted to describe and demonstrate how technology is making its way into things that it might not seem "appropriate" for, like cooking. My other two options were construction and graphic design, as I like these topics in general and wanted to demonstrate how technology impacts them.
