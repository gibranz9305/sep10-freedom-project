## My Freedom Project Topic
For my **Software Engineering Project** creative topic the topic I chose was cooking. The reason I chose the topic of cooking is because I notice how the world of tehcnology and coding has slowly made its way into something which doesnt really seem like it has any correlation to it. I wanted to describe and demonstrate how technology is making its way into things that it might not seem "appropriate" for, like cooking. My other two options were construction and graphic design, as I like these topics in general and wanted to demonstrate how technology impacts them.

### Sources
For my sources, I am using **[links like these](https://kosciuskoconnect.com/blog/how-technology-is-changing-the-way-we-cook/)** which show me how exaclty tehcnology and coding is being brought to cooking to help with efficency and overall imporving interactions for people in daily life. In links [like these](https://ajeanneinthekitchen.com/2024/03/06/cooking-with-technology/), they talk about the benefits that technology brings and how exaclty technology benefits and is making the topic of cooking turn out for the better. For my backup ideas, like **construction** I was going to use a link like [this](https://www.rhumbix.com/blog/how-technology-in-construction-is-revolutionizing-the-industry) to demonstrate how technology is helping worksites by making them safer and using 3D printing to increase efficency.

### EDP 
Edp, also known as the _Engineering Design Process_ is a problem solving method that people use to address a challenge by following steps, like researching. As this blog can be applied to this process, I can safely say that I am currently in step 4 of the process, which is **_Brainstorm possible solutions_**. 
I say I am in this step because I have already constructed a general idea of the project in my head, what topic I will pick, how I will relate and contribute that project into modern technology and coding, but have not yet had a stable guaranteed base of what my website will be designed as, and I am neither on step 4, **Plan the most promising solution**
as I do not yet have a 100% sure way of the structure of my descriptions and overall website design.

#### Skills

Some skills, or ways that I have been developing in through the help of this blog but also of everyday life is **Collaboration** and **How to Google**. The reason I say these two skills specifically is because of time managment and efficiency. In order to maximize my time working on projects for multiple classes and also just simply for convience, ive learned to use many shortcuts available of the chromebook such as _control+c and control+v_ to copy and paste things, and using **Control+F** to find specific words on pages that I might have thought was siginifcant but lost track of it throughout the reading. 

I also said that I was growing in collabortaion skills as I have learned to first try my best, trying different methods and trying to steer away from methods that are incorrect. If I am stuck, then I will use the help of my classmates or others to not provide me with the answer, but give me general tips that allow me to think and get the correct answer or goal without just giving it to me. This also helps me contribute with others in groupa activities or in scenarios with more than 1 person.

##### Summary

In all, I am excited to further develop my freedom project and see how it will turn out in the end, using all of my ideas and hard work to really push my creativity and my website design, as I have never done something quite like this before.
