# Entry 3
I brainstormed part B, which is possible tech inventions for cooking in the future by seeing what problems were still present currently, as well as common mistakes many people do. For exmaple, I looked at a website like [this](https://www.fda.gov/food/alerts-advisories-safety-information/fda-issues-warning-about-imported-cookware-may-leach-lead-august-2025#:~:text=What's%20the%20Problem?,food%20cooked%20using%20these%20products.), which talks about lead being in cookwear, which can leech and poison the food that you eat. Any person that does not know what they are doing can easily get sick from using cookwear. Additonally, people can struggle with overcooking and undercooking, resulting in their food not having the best taste.
