## Overview/Introduction/Context
* Cooking is prehistoric, as it began with early humans using fire to cook as far as 780,000 years ago.
* Over time, cooking has become easier with the inventions of many machines and the learning of many cooking techniques to make different foods.
* This site will look at some cooking technological innovations that make cooking easier and enjoyable, and are used in everyday life.
  

## Part A: existing technology
* *Least Complex*
* Cooking Apps
* 1st website I looked [at](https://medium.com/@prausev/whisk-the-ultimate-cooking-app-ca0207b5b2ce)
  * This app can organize ingredient lists and instructions.
  * This app offers recipies that its users can use
  * This app allows you to add ingreidents of a recipie to a shopping list
  * Can review the "health score" of different foods
    
* Second website
  * Technology used in cooking can refer to "smart" appliances, precison tools, AI powered and voice controled ovens.
* 2nd website I looked at [here](https://www.wptasty.com/best-cooking-apps)
  * The _Tasty_ app is a cooking app that has video guided recipes, cooking tips, and more.
  * The app gives step by step instructions. Available on IOS and Adroid devices.
    
 *More Complex*
  
 3D Food Printing
  
   Food Printing uses additive manufacturing to create food by depositing ingredients layer by layer from food-grade syringes and nozzles.
 This Technology allows for more complex and custom-designed foods

Sous Vide Machines

  These machines cooks vacuum sealed food in a tempertaure controlled water bath to a precise temperature. This machine is great as it makes sure food is cooked perfectly and evenly, and can result in enhanced flavors as the bag traps natural juices.

Smart Refrigirators

  These refigirators besides providing basic cooling allow you to remotely change its temperature, give you recipies based on whats in your fridge, entertainment options with touchscreens, and inventory managament.

## Part B: possible future technology
* Idea
  * Detail
